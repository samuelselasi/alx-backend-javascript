# Full Server
![What-is-ExpressJS](https://github.com/samuelselasi/alx-backend-javascript/assets/85158665/fb703575-a02c-41d9-a9a5-9aea47609433)

### 8.1 Organize the structure of the server
* Create `2` directories within:
	* `controllers`
	* `routes`
* Create a file [full_server/utils.js](./utils.js), in the file create a function named `readDatabase` that accepts a file path as argument:
	* It should read the database asynchronously
	* It should return a promise
	* When the file is not accessible, it should reject the promise with the error
	* When the file can be read, it should return an object of arrays of the firstname of students per fields

### 8.2 Write the App controller
Inside the file [full_server/controllers/AppController.js](./controllers/AppController.js):

* Create a class named `AppController`. Add a static method named `getHomepage`
* The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument. It returns a `200` status and the message `Hello Holberton School!`

### 8.3 Write the Students controller
Inside the file [full_server/controllers/StudentsController.js](./controllers/StudentsController.js), create a class named `StudentsController`. Add two static methods:

The first one is `getAllStudents`:

* The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument
* It should return a status `200`
* It calls the function `readDatabase` from the `utils` file, and display in the page:
	* **First line**: `This is the list of our students`
	* And for each field (*order by alphabetic order case insensitive*), a line that displays the number of students in the field, and the list of first names (*ordered by appearance in the database file*) with the following format: `Number of students in FIELD: 6. List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES`
* If the database is not available, it should return a status `500` and the error message `Cannot load the database`

The second one is `getAllStudentsByMajor`:

* The method accepts `request` and `response` as argument
* It should return a status `200`
* It uses a parameter that the user can pass to the browser `major`.
The `major` can only be `CS` or `SWE`.
If the user is passing another parameter,
the server should return a `500` and the error `Major parameter must be CS or SWE`
* It calls the function `readDatabase` from the `utils` file, and display in the page the list of first names for the students (*ordered by appearance in the database file*) in the specified field `List: LIST_OF_FIRSTNAMES_IN_THE_FIELD`
* If the database is not available, it should return a status `500` and the error message `Cannot load the database`

### 8.4 Write the routes
Inside the file [full_server/routes/index.js](./routes/index.js):

* Link the route `/` to the `AppController`
* Link the route `/students` and `/students/:major` to the `StudentsController`

### 8.5 Write the server reusing everything you created
Inside the file named [full_server/server.js](./server.js), create a small `Express` server:

* It should use the routes defined in `full_server/routes/index.js`
* It should use the port `1245`

### 8.6 Update `package.json` (if you are running it from outside the folder full_server)
If you are starting node from outside of the folder `full_server`, you will have to update the command `dev` by: `nodemon --exec babel-node --presets babel-preset-env ./full_server/server.js ./database.csv`

#### Warning:

* Donâ€™t forget to export your express app at the end of `server.js` (`export default app;`)
* The database filename is passed as argument of the `server.js` **BUT**, for testing purpose, you should retrieve this filename at the execution (when `getAllStudents` or g`etAllStudentsByMajor` are called for example)

**In terminal 1**:
```
bob@dylan:~$ npm run dev
...
```
**In terminal 2**:
```
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245 && echo ""
Hello Holberton School!
bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/students && echo ""

bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/students/SWE && echo ""

bob@dylan:~$ 
bob@dylan:~$ curl localhost:1245/students/French -vvv && echo ""

If you want to add test to validate your integration, you will need to add this file: `.babelrc`
```
{
    "presets": [["env", {"exclude": ["transform-regenerator"]}]]
}
```
